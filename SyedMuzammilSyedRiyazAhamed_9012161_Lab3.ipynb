    "##### In this lab, the goal is to develop and evaluate models that effectively classify images of dogs and cats, leveraging both a custom-designed neural network and transfer learning using a pre-trained model, VGG16. This exercise will help in understanding the process of building and fine-tuning deep learning models on a specific task with proper evaluation and insights into the performance of the model."
